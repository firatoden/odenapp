On occasion, in order to respond to a question or request from a child through our apps, OdenApp may receive or need to ask for the child’s online contact information, such as an email address. OdenApp will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.

<li>Photos, Videos, and Audio. Our Apps may request access to the device’s photo album, or microphone in order to provide in-game functionality. For example, a child may say anything microphone in order to imitate call with the animals or save their drawing to their local device.
